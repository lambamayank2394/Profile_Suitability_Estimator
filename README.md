# Profile_Suitability_Estimator
The job market today is expanding both horizontally and vertically. This means huge amounts of data would be created not only related to hundreds of thousands of job descriptions for those jobs but also of the profile information of millions of people who would essentially be applying to those jobs. Therein lies the opportunity of leveraging Big Data technologies to help employers to better estimate how suitable different potential candidates would be certain jobs. We intend to build a system that processes the data related to different job listings, resume data, and other profile information collected from various business and employment-oriented websites (like linkedin, indeed, etc.) using Natural Language Processing which can then be fed to a machine learning model in order to provide a score that will help us in the eventual estimation. The applications of this projects can range from filtering under qualified candidates to building recommendation systems over this implementation.
